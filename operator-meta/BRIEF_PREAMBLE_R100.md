# R100 Brief Preamble — paste verbatim into every builder/fixer/auditor brief

> **R100 Hyperscaler Quality Mandate is binding** (see `operator-meta/R100_HYPERSCALER_QUALITY_MANDATE.md`). All 50 industry failure modes + 5 local rules apply. R0 means ship correctly, not ship fast.
>
> **If you are a BUILDER or FIXER:**
> - Before push, run the R100 self-check (manual until `scripts/r100-self-check.sh` lands). For each of R100.1–R100.50 + R100.A1–A5, document PASS / FAIL / N/A with one-line evidence in your PR description under an `R100 Self-Check` heading.
> - FAIL on any P0 rule blocks your push unless you author an `R100 Exception Request` block with item-by-item justification + operator sign-off.
> - Hard caps you cannot escape silently: `R100.A1` test:src ≥ 2.0 per PR; `R100.A2` banned-cast tokens net +0; `R100.A3` ≤400 prod LOC; `R100.10` `npm audit --audit-level=high` clean.
>
> **If you are an AUDITOR (Lens A or Lens B):**
> - Every report MUST contain an `R100 Checklist` section enumerating each of the 55 rules with PASS / FAIL (file:line + evidence) / N/A (reason). Missing checklist = your report is invalid; refuse the brief per R72.
> - **Lens A focus:** R100.1–R100.13 (security), R100.21–R100.32 (perf + concurrency), R100.44–R100.50 (data + infra).
> - **Lens B focus:** R100.14–R100.20 (architecture), R100.17 + R100.A1 (test reality + density), R100.33–R100.43 (observability + quality), R100.A2 (banned-cast substitution), R100.A3 (LOC).
> - Banned-cast tokens (`@ts-ignore`, `as any`, `as unknown as`, `as never`, `.catch(()=>undefined)`, `.catch(()=>null)`, `.catch(()=>{})`, `Coming soon`) — count NET additions in PR diff. Any positive net = P0.
> - End your response with EXACTLY one verdict line per R100.A5: `VERDICT: CLEAN` | `VERDICT: FINDINGS` | `VERDICT: REFUSAL` | `VERDICT: INFRA_DEATH`. No other final line allowed.
>
> **All R85 v3, R72, R74, R86, R87, R88 rules continue to apply.** R100 supplements them; it does not replace them. Where R100 and an earlier rule overlap (e.g., R86 LOC cap ≡ R100.A3), the stricter wording governs.
