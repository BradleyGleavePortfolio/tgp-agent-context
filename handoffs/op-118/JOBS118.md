## B-FEES15-118 (builder, Claude Opus 5.5, T4) — fees F2 #682 + F3 #683, then merge-only restack F4 #684 -> F4b #697 -> F5 #685 -> F6 #686
Job one of the whole launch: recurring is stacked on fees, so every fees round forces a recurring restack. Land-quality, once.
Heads: #681 F1 e9650dc4 (dual APPROVE, do not touch), #682 a2051568, #683 33a9d83b, #684 7872a533, #697 b8b63e63, #685 8dc2c2ed,
#686 13c814f7. Take lock `fees`.
- #682: Sol APPROVE 0/0/0 (5977674117). Opus RC 0/1/3 (5977756869): B-682-9 — round-14 test adds banned R75 tokens
  (`test/s-fee-r11-reversal-admission-diagnostics.spec.ts` :357/:371 `page as never`, :369 `.catch(() => undefined)`); the composed
  candidate fails the required "Banned cast tokens" check when F1 carries the stack to main. Dead builder B-F3-117 left two unpushed
  commits on branch ci/B-F3-117-682-r75-after (4482adcd, 5a57e220; its lane run 37186992337 FAILED — find out why). It typed the
  array as `any`; use a genuinely neutral typed form instead (no `any`, `as never`, `as unknown as`, empty catch). Prove with
  `node scripts/check-r75.js --mode=range --base=b644198b90bb9ab1dc62a78794e12cf09f8ace7c --head=<sha>` at F2, at the restacked fees top
  #686, and on a scratch merge of the recurring top (#701 67905b43) with your fees top: no positive class anywhere.
  #682 stays red by design with exactly the 4 tests Sol/Opus verified (F4 carries them); say so with the run URL.
- #683: Sol RC 0/2/2 (5977674319), Opus RC 0/1/4 (5977756981; corrected from APPROVE). Fix:
  - Sol B-683-1 (both lenses): deferred-fee awaiting->settled currency switch compares presentment cents with settlement cents
    (`src/connect/fees/charge-settlement.service.ts` :687-691 with :1421-1455 and the claim's currency rewrite :722). Rule: take
    row.refunded_cents into the max only when row.currency equals the settlement currency; otherwise derive succeeded refunds in the
    settlement currency from the list (as before round 13); list unreadable -> stay awaiting, nothing moved. Verify the two CAD->USD
    deferred cases pay USD 56.40, store 2000 USD, reconcile to zero drift after retry/replay; same-currency, changed-FX higher/lower,
    pending/failed refund and head-coach controls; late converted refund notices unchanged.
  - Sol B-683-5 (Opus rates C; fix it, it is cheap and a Sol B): never clear a retry flag raised by the current run (propagate the
    notice-recording failure, or clear with a CAS on the observed flag value). Verify same-instant failure keeps retry authority and a
    later sweep creates the notice once with no second reversal.
  - Replay every prior probe: Sol's spec `test/aud-sol-f23-117-settlement-boundaries.spec.ts` (parent of commit
    80ca936a2f1443f91f8140f094fd09d9ca5f1943; `git fetch origin <sha>`), audit/AUD-SOL-F34-117/{683-boundaries,683-boundaries-v2,
    684-refunds,684-refunds-budget}, and the round-13/14 probes named in the #683/#684 verdict threads. #683 stays red by design with
    exactly 3 suites / 9 tests (state the run).
  - FREEZE: C-683-4 (both lenses' different C-683-4s), Sol C-683-6 = Opus C-683-5, C-682-5/6/7 go to your report as follow-ups.
- Then merge-only restack #684 -> #697 -> #685 -> #686 (no content edits; if a conflict forces one, that piece gets a FIX ROUND with
  failing-before evidence). Post `FIX ROUND <k> (merge-only restack ...)` + READY on each at green heads. Release the lock and write
  notify/fees.txt: "fees top: #686 @ <sha> (B-FEES15-118, <time>)". Do not touch #678-#701.

## B-RECUR6A-118 (builder, Claude Opus 5.5, T4) — recurring R1 #678 + R2 #679 (MOST CRITICAL OF ALL)
Heads: #678 b04ea692 (base fees F6 #686), #679 6760ee6a. Above them (NOT yours): #680 9621457e, #696 5225e078, #701 67905b43; a
second builder (B-RECUR6B-118) takes #680/#696/#701 after you end. Take lock `recur` while you push.
- #678: Sol APPROVE 0/0/0 at b04ea692 (5977830820); Opus APPROVE 0/0/1 at 0c2191c0 (old, 5977231057).
- #679: Sol RC 0/3/1 at 6760ee6a (5977831040): B-679-7 pre-send marker does not fence account finalization (delete during
  post-claim/pre-reply still sends a paid create); B-679-8 unknown rejected-bind cleanup releases the one-subscription exclusion;
  B-679-10 a null pending SetupIntent (Stripe returns none when the customer already has a default card) makes an eligible native trial
  unavailable or permanently confirming. B-679-10 is the "clients with a saved card cannot start a trial" gap from the handoff: fix it
  with more functionality, never less (attempt-owned SetupIntent presented in the native sheet; lift the trial end only on that
  intent's success; one trial per client per coach; a customer default card is never this attempt's consent). C-679-3 -> report.
  Opus RC 0/2/1 at f48fa8f0 (5977231156): Sol says Opus B-679-8/9 are closed at round 5; confirm with the tests.
- Dead Opus lens AUD-OPUS-R12R5-117 left probes on audit/AUD-OPUS-R12R5-117/679-probes (commit 86ebd91a on 6760ee6a; lane run
  37187184830, 2 failed at head): "Opus B-679-10 a client whose customer already has a default card and a trial package can start the
  plan: no SETUP_UNAVAILABLE on a first or a later attempt" and "Opus B-678-2 the generic default-card update carries the trial-end
  lift: a default-card update on a paid plan never touches cancel_at_period_end". Treat both as findings: verify, fix (#678 for
  B-678-2), and make those probes pass.
- Replay every prior probe from both lenses on #678/#679 (threads + audit/* branches) and do the money self-check (_COMMON_118 6).
- If notify/fees.txt shows a new fees top while you work, merge it into #678 then #679 (merge-only) before your final push.
- When #678 and #679 are READY at green heads: write notify/recur.txt "recur R2 top: #679 @ <sha> (B-RECUR6A-118, <time>)", release
  the lock, END. Do not touch #680/#696/#701.

Decide your lens's prior findings first, then audit both rounds deeply. The builder says two Opus probes stay red by design (C-672-7
date wording per the ruling "Oct 13 at 12:30 AM EDT"; C-671-4 direct view probe because T1 is unchanged and T3's writer holds the
contract): Opus decides that with evidence. Binding: real free trials (coach sets 0-30 days, card up front, one per client per coach,
trial-ending notice), MRR/churned_30d exclude never-billed trials. Landing context: trials land after recurring (#678-#701) and carry the

## B-TR3-118 (builder, Claude Opus 5.5, T4: free trials, money, notices) — trials T2 #672 + T3 #673
Heads: #672 c5e7ed8e35f1e5b88653e5605dded2af8614182d (base T1 #671 c75002c9, dual APPROVE, do not touch), #673
df76889fb862095170498dccb23f35db3d116690. Opus APPROVE on both (#672 0/0/5 B 5982465734; #673 0/0/3 5982465887). Sol REQUEST CHANGES:
- #672 0/1/1 (5982319373): B-672-3 remains: an extension or cancellation during push preparation permits obsolete charge/date copy.
- #673 0/1/2 (5982336690): B-673-1 (new): cancellation retries can delete an already-paid subscription when its conversion webhook is
  delayed or missing. Sol's optional duplicate-cancellation clock fix sits on the same lines: fold it in.
Same-line Opus Cs to fold in only if they are the same code as a B fix: C-672-11 (a stale trial_will_end writes a "will be charged"
in-app row), C-673-2 (an older retried event rewrites an extended trial end). Everything else (C-672-10, C-673-1, carried C-672-3/5/6b)
goes to your report. C-673-3 (coach metrics count never-billed trials in MRR/churn; binding ruling) is outside these diffs: it goes on
the #680 integration list, not here.
SIZE: #672 is at 2,977 lines (23 lines headroom). New tests go to #673; if the #672 source fix needs room, move an existing whole test
file from #672 to #673 byte-identical (add it after the merge so restacks cannot delete it) and say so. Replay every prior probe from
both lenses (#672 probes run 37218788517, #673 probes run 37219356220, Sol runs 37218265800/37218424769; Opus's red-by-design C-672-7 and
C-671-4 probes stay as ruled). Money self-check per _COMMON_118 6. FIX ROUND + READY on both at green heads.

## B-DUNA-118 (builder, Claude Opus 5.5, T4: dunning, billing lockout, money copy) — dunning D1 #687 + D2 #688
Heads: #687 f8e47bf40fe81064d679fc2831cedf3b1cd90b2c (base main, BEHIND: merge main first, merge-only), #688
b17f514ccd8da195d18588ca4b7ca407a789f20e (base #687's branch). Take lock `dunning`. Both lenses REQUEST CHANGES:
- Sol #687 0/2/0 (5982357490): rejected Expo push tickets are recorded as "sent"; the email promises payment/access before success.
- Sol #688 0/2/0 (5982357473): a historical lost-dispute replay blocks later recovery; null-first capped selection hides a lock.
- Opus #687 0/1/3 (5982478903): B-687-5 reversed-payment emails tell clients a card update pays the debt and keeps access; it does neither.
  Fix the main dispute-cycle copy in the same round.
- Opus #688 0/2/3 (5982479051): B-688-6 a stale sweep worker can lock a just-reopened cycle on Day 0 with no notices sent; B-688-7 the
  Day-1 client email shows a raw `{cardLast4}` and the Day-7 coach email shows `{reason}` four times.
- Same-line Cs to fold in: C-687-6, C-688-10. Other Cs (C-687-7, C-688-8, C-688-9) go to your report. C-687-4 stays a note (OR-113-4:
  pending migration prefixes keep their numbers).
SIZE: #688 is at 2,926 lines (74 headroom): put the B-688-7 template fallback in D1 (#687) as Opus recommends; new D2 tests may go to
D5 (#691, tests-only) only if D2 would pass 3,000 (byte-identical moves, add after the merge). Copy truth is binding (dunning rulings in the
D12 entry): never promise access, payment or a charge before it is true. Replay every prior probe from both lenses
(ops/aud-118/AUD-SOL-D12-118/, ops/aud-118/AUD-OPUS-D12-118/, earlier verdict threads). Money self-check per _COMMON_118 6. Do NOT touch
D3-D5 (#689-#691): AUD-*-D34-118 found 9+ Bs there and a second builder (B-DUNB-118) takes them after you; findings you see in D3/D4 code go

truth, identity fences, no raw provider errors or health values in logs). Check that retiring Samsung Health removes every code path,
permission, copy line and stored connection state (existing users with a Samsung connection must see a truthful state, not a broken

unconfirmed codes); #343 Sol RC 0/5/0 (5976959713), Opus RC 0/1/2 (5977006549; B-343-1 "Payment received" before proof). Opus's
C-342-1 probe stays red by design (C held under the freeze). Lands with recurring (backend #678-#701) and must work against TODAY's
production backend too (no subscription-intent route there: capability check or truthful fallback, never a dead end). Check the reply
codes from backend #661 (409 PAYMENT_ALREADY_COMPLETE, PAYMENT_REFUNDED_OR_IN_REVIEW, PAYMENT_CHECKOUT_CLOSED; 503 PAYMENT_IN_PROGRESS;
PAYMENT_SUCCESS_RETRY / PAYMENT_FAILURE_RETRY) and the recurring codes (PLAN_CHANGE_UNCONFIRMED, SETUP_UNAVAILABLE, trial setup) each
map to specific, truthful copy with a working next action; trial starts never show payment-complete copy; never claim
charged/not charged/paid before proof; recurring is never one-time-only; no first person in copy. P3 #344 (e7fcc5d2) gets its own pair

Both lenses REQUEST CHANGES on #362; their IDs collide, so close the UNION (mapping in ops/reports/AUD-OPUS-H45-118.md):
- Sol 0/4/1 (5982471782): raw retirement-error logging; a stale account-A disconnect deletes account B's authorization; health reads
  continue after disconnect; empty-import guidance dismissed by the real parent.
- Opus 0/2/4 (5982561308): B-362-1 a first import that brings in nothing closes the sheet as if it worked (no "where to check" message;
  on iPhone this is what every category off looks like); B-362-2 Android "access is turned off" notice says "Then tap Try again" but
  no Try again button exists.
- Same-line Cs to fold in: C-362-1 (raw error to the dev logger at useWearableConnections.ts:120), C-362-2 (403 notice says "Tap
  Continue" but the button reads "Reconnect"), C-362-3 (Disconnect does not stop a running import). C-362-4 (connect sheet "We'll

coach-visible money equals the ledger to the cent, MRR and churned_30d exclude never-billed trials (C-673-3 depends on #676's billed

1. Merge #679 8bbf4a41 into #680 (merge-tree is clean per B-RECUR6A). Read ops/reports/B-RECUR6A-118.md "## HANDOFF": R1's
   setSubscriptionDefaultPaymentMethod lifts the trial end only with `liftTrialEnd: true` (test/b-recur-fix-round-1-trial-card.spec.ts:172
   needs it); the own trial SetupIntent (metadata tgp_purchase_id, tgp_subscription_id, tgp_checkout: native_subscription_trial) is not
   tied to the subscription by Stripe: the #680 setup_intent.succeeded handler must attach it via attachTrialCard when it sees that metadata.
2. Close every open B on #680: Sol RC at 8e05ad0e (5977195657) as answered by FIX ROUND 5 (9621457e, 5977718408): verify each closure;
   the dead Sol lens AUD-SOL-R34R5-117 left unposted probes on branch audit/AUD-SOL-R34R5-117/680-authority (run 37187197172): B-680-2
   residual and B-680-5 (two cases): reproduce, fix, keep the probes as failing-before tests. Opus APPROVE at 8e05ad0e (5977283278).
3. Report-only (do not build unless it is your code): AUD-OPUS-SH3-118 says a plan locked out at Day 10 shows "confirming" with no End my
   plan; say whether recurring or dunning owns it. C-673-3 (coach MRR counts never-billed trials) needs #676's BILLED_WHERE: not here.
   #661 (hosted checkout, lands after fees) conflicts with the recurring top: list the conflicting files and the resolution you expect.
4. Money self-check per _COMMON_118 6 (webhook order and redelivery, concurrency, terminal states, pagination, currency, copy truth).
   Recurring is never one-time-only.
5. FIX ROUND + READY on #680; merge-only restack #696 and #701 with READY (restack) comments (new tests go to #696/#701 if #680 nears
   3,000). Write notify/recur.txt "recur top: #701 @ <sha> (B-RECUR6B-118, <time>)"; release the lock. Report: ops/reports/B-RECUR6B-118.md.

## B-SHEET2-118 (builder, Claude Opus 5.5, T4: payment sheet money copy) — mobile P1 #342 + P2 #343 (P3 #344 is the next builder's)
Heads: #342 56f281ad3aa977882c962a6591d3594899cdd5a1 (base main; 2,018 lines), #343 fd739d5819c232764e0389afd778860bf452b41c (2,813; 187
lines headroom). Take lock `sheet`. Rules from the B-SHEET-118 and AUD-*-SH-118 entries (copy truth: never claim charged/not
charged/paid before proof; #661 and recurring reply codes map to specific truthful copy with a working next action; today's production
backend fallback; recurring never one-time-only; no first person). Findings:
- #342: Opus APPROVE 0/0/5 (5982679049). Sol RC 0/2/1 (5982676839): a timeout incorrectly claims no charge; JPY (zero-decimal) amounts
  display 100x too small (fix with the currency's minor-unit exponent, all zero-decimal currencies, not a JPY special case).
- #343: Opus RC 0/1/5 (5982679186): B-343-6 usePackagePurchase.ts:746-748/790-791 a one-time plan that became free after the list
  loaded shows "Payment received. Setting up your plan." during the free claim (fix rule: claimFree sets saleKind "free"; Opus CI-lane
  probe run 37221093192). Sol RC 0/3/2 (5982700210): rejected-read account fence; misleading "Open your plan" destination (Opus C-343-3
  is the same: make the action truthful now, e.g. label/route to what it does); ended subscription incorrectly treated as unpaid (Opus
  C-343-4 "nothing was charged" on an ended plan is the same lines: fold in).
Replay both lenses' probes (ops/aud-118/AUD-OPUS-SH-118/probes/, ops/aud-118/AUD-SOL-SH-118/). If #343 would pass 3,000, move whole test
files up to #344 byte-identical (after the merge) and say so; #344 itself is NOT yours to fix (merge-only restack #344 at the end so
it carries your heads, with a READY (restack) comment). Held Cs stay held (C-342-1 isCombo red by design, C-342-2, C-343-2). FIX ROUND +
READY on #342 and #343 at green heads; write notify/sheet.txt; release the lock. Report: ops/reports/B-SHEET2-118.md.

dispute resolution, cancellation authority, out-of-band selection, lock order) and #690 0/5/1 (5982476848: invoice resurrection, dispute
serialization, unpaid grace, failure/cancel race, acknowledged persistence failure); Opus RC #689 0/1/2 (5982575687: B-689-5
client-billing.service.ts:323-330 reversed amount from the last failed renewal, not the disputed charge; minimal fix show no amount, probe
