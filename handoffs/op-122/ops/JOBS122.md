### B-DUNR3-122 — dunning train: main merge, restack, move D3-D5 onto D2d, fix Opus B-689-5 (T4 money/access; stack lock: dunning)
Builder: Claude Opus 5.5. Time box 75 minutes (READY by about 16:35 PDT). Take lock ops/lanes122/locks/dunning.
Train (lands as one, A5 rule 11), current heads:
- D1 #687 d86b31a67e1d89352c3e92dde674cb4d45a25a1a, base main, DIRTY vs main cb986a4c: one conflict in
  src/notifications/emitters/coach-alert.emitter.ts (prisma/schema.prisma, .env.example, test/privacy/no-pii-in-logs.spec.ts auto-merge).
- D2a #688 2662d01a82c267f00af27566e3984d58fb0996d1 (base #687), D2b #704 764af2e1df66612c503427016f83c3d1776cfdc0 (base #688),
  D2c #705 2a03d7dd1d39e2553df10f4d7e10ecdb025807aa (base #704), D2d #724 e77a8d360f7a7ad02cf465b525eeed648a3a7825 (base #705).
- D3 #689 bb992fedf0095446f916f3261742bd262c3d94da (base = #688's branch agent115/dunning-split-2-dunning-service at an OLD head from
  10-04), D4 #690 06307883100ec142aa2818fc30ee276cab26c1ec (base #689), D5 #691 e0afe6780e5954b20e88cfaefd63f12cd31d218d (base #690,
  tests). `git merge-tree` of #724 into #689 is clean at these heads.
Background: ops/reports/B-DUND2D-121.md (D2d design, HANDOFF), B-DUNR2-120.md, B-DUNMR-120.md, AUD-OPUS-D6-120.md,
AUD-SOL-D6-120.md; SoT A9.2 "B-DUNB-120" (rulings: D3 adopts main's Stripe method signatures; the dispute-pause check runs whether or not
FEATURE_DUNNING_V2 is on; D2c does not set `disputed` when it pauses; dispute event time is closedAt in D4).
Work, in order (one push per PR):
1. #687: `git merge origin/main` once; resolve coach-alert.emitter.ts keeping main's behaviour (push alerts go through the push sender
   from b#692 only, no second sender) plus #687's additions; list every resolved hunk in the comment. Verify migrations of the whole
   train sort and apply after main's (main added scheduling 20270222000000, push 20270307000000, messaging and coach-payout migrations;
   production applied all of them at 14:5x and 15:0x): no timestamp collision, the foundation-fixes migration-order test and Schema
   parity pass, `prisma migrate deploy` applies the train's migrations on top of main's (Migration Dry-Run check on #687 proves it).
2. Merge-only restack #688 <- new #687, #704 <- #688, #705 <- #704, #724 <- #705 (one merge commit each, tree == `git merge-tree`
   result, no content edits; if a merge conflicts, resolve and list the hunk).
3. Move D3-D5 onto D2d: merge the new #724 head into #689's branch; fix only what breaks (compile, tests) and apply the rulings above
   where #689/#690 still differ; then `gh pr edit 689 --base agent121/dunning-split-2d-restart-fixes`; restack #690 <- #689 and
   #691 <- #690.
4. Fix Opus B-689-5 (comment 5982575687), the only open item-list B on D3-D5: the disputed amount the client sees (quote
   disputes[].amount_cents, the card-result quote, and the card-result copy "Your bank reversed an earlier payment of $X") must come from
   the dispute ledger (ChargeDispute amount_cents/currency) or be omitted when unknown; never DunningState.last_failed_amount_cents.
   Failing-before test (Opus probe P3, run 37220145001). #689 has 87 lines of room: if the test does not fit, put it in #691 (258 room).
5. Do NOT fix (operator reclassified to "C (edge, deferred to 10k clients)" under the owner freeze, comments posted by the operator):
   Sol B-689-1, B-689-4, B-689-5, B-689-6 (5982476834); Sol B-690-1, B-690-2, B-690-5, B-690-6, B-690-7 (5982476848). Opus C-689-3,
   C-689-4, C-D2D-1/2/3 stay C. Keep the four already-built edge fixes in #724 (operator accepts B-DUND2D-121 decision 1, default keep).
6. Evidence: one CI lane (ci/B-DUNR3-122-1) at the new #691 head with `.ci-lane-tsc` plus every dunning/billing/dispute spec the train
   touches (test/dunning*, client-billing, checkout-webhook-handler, refund-dispute-handler, foundation-fixes, lockout guard) and the
   B-689-5 test. #687's own PR CI (all 11 required checks) must be green. Pieces' own CI is not required (A5 rule 11).
7. Comments, each ending READY FOR AUDIT and stating exactly what changed since the previous head (merge-only tree proof, or hunks/lines):
   FIX ROUND 5 (B-DUNR3-122, agent 122) on #687; RESTACK on #688, #704, #705, #724; FIX ROUND 3 on #689; RESTACK on #690; RESTACK (or
   FIX ROUND if the test lands there) on #691. Then write ops/lanes122/notify/dunning.txt with the eight new full heads and the lane run.
Size: check every PR before pushing (caps in _COMMON_122 item 5).

### AUD-OPUS-DUN1-122 / AUD-SOL-DUN1-122 — dunning train + #725, one pass under RUTHLESS SCOPE (T4; lands as one)
Lens: Claude Opus 5.5 (AUD-OPUS) and GPT-6.1 Sol (AUD-SOL), independent. Time box: 75 minutes including the wait for the builder.
Part 1 now: b#725 1dbc59b690119f03f010e406f9f1e0e43d1e6556 (base main, 117 lines: a client locked out by billing can still reach their
own coach's message thread, B-353-10). Builder report ops/reports/B-DUND2D-121.md. CI re-running (operator 15:1x): do not block on
queued checks; say which are green. Post your verdict on #725 first.
Part 2 now: read the dunning train for item-list problems only (money charged/refunded/reversed wrong, access wrongly kept or ended,
client- or coach-facing copy that is false, private or payment data to the wrong person, a core pay/cancel/card-update flow that
dead-ends). Content to read: D1-D2d at #724 e77a8d360f7a7ad02cf465b525eeed648a3a7825 (stack #687 -> #688 -> #704 -> #705 -> #724) and
D3-D5 at #691 e0afe6780e5954b20e88cfaefd63f12cd31d218d. Builder B-DUNR3-122 is merging main into #687 (one conflict:
coach-alert.emitter.ts), restacking everything, moving D3-D5 onto #724 and fixing Opus B-689-5 (disputed amount shown to the client).
Prior verdicts: verify only your own lens's earlier open Bs. Opus: #687 RC at f3c7fd37 (6000205361; FR4 6000627026 claims the fix),
#705 RC at 5138947c (6000206086; fixes in #705 2a03d7dd + #724), #689 RC (5982575687, B-689-5), #690 APPROVE (5982575812). Sol: #687
APPROVE at f3c7fd37 (5999796451), #688 and #704 APPROVE at 21714f7b / 49d0b66e, #705 RC (5999840529), #689 RC (5982476834), #690 RC
(5982476848). Operator reclassified to C (edge, deferred to 10k clients): Sol B-689-1/4/5/6 and B-690-1/2/5/6/7; B-DUND2D-121's four
built edge fixes stay. Background: ops/reports/B-DUND2D-121.md, B-DUNR2-120.md, B-DUNMR-120.md, your lens's AUD-*-D6-120.md.
Part 3: poll ops/lanes122/notify/dunning.txt and the PR comments every 5 minutes for the builder's READY FOR AUDIT. Then check each
piece's delta (main-merge conflict hunk on #687; merge-only restacks by tree equality; #689's move onto #724 and the B-689-5 fix) and post
ONE verdict per PR at the new exact heads: #687, #688, #704, #705, #724, #689, #690, #691. If the builder is not READY by 16:45 PDT, post
nothing on the train, put your findings in your report with ## HANDOFF and end.

APPROVE at 3d95f96e; #707 RC both at ffed434e (Sol 5985426719, Opus 5985519108).
Review only the delta since your lens's last verdict head on each piece: the main refresh (#671: ci.yml, 2 hunks), the 3 conflict hunks
in #673 src/checkout/checkout-webhook-handler.service.ts, #673 FIX ROUND 12 (B-TR8-120: ONE SHARED TRIAL RULE: one trial per client per
coach, any kind; claimed in the webhook at trial start; only the winning purchase gets the marker; a losing purchase gets no access and
owes a cancellation), #707 FIX ROUND 2 (B-TR7-120) against your own #707 Bs, and the #706 tests. Reports: ops/reports/B-TR9-121.md,
B-TR8-120.md, B-TR7-120.md. Item-list problems only (a client charged when they should not be, a second free trial, a trial that grants
or keeps access wrongly, false trial copy, a checkout dead end). CI was re-run by the operator at 15:1x: do not block on queued checks;
say which are green. One verdict per PR at the exact head (5 comments).

### B-WIZ3-122 — coach wizard W2 m#346 fix + W3 m#347 known items, restack the money train m#348-#351 (T3/T4: publishes priced offers)
Builder: Claude Opus 5.5. Time box 60 minutes (READY by about 17:00 PDT). Lock ops/lanes122/locks/wizard.
Stack: m#345 ed29833c (base main, dual APPROVE: Sol 5998775552, Opus 5999046073) -> #346 26cf23b7987c866615ab9a4b2f95a10e6e318f40
(Opus APPROVE 5999046333; Sol RC 5998775024) -> #347 8437fb94aa031b906e26f33f734097d9af2f9bc5 (Sol APPROVE 5998774888; Opus APPROVE
5999046635 covered the restack delta only, NOT W3's own diff) -> money train #348 90501f847e03cf4cc1071503436acdd459643103 (conflicts with
its base #347) -> #349 35aa8163 -> #350 6fb21216 -> #351 352d768e (full shas via `git -C /home/user/workspace/growth-project-mobile
rev-parse pm348` etc.; #349/#350 are red by design until #351; land as one).
Work: read SoT A9.2 "B-WIZ3-120" word for word (it is your plan) with this operator scoping under RUTHLESS SCOPE:
1. #346: B-346-3 + Opus C-346-7 together, minimal: Create/Publish stays disabled until the saved package has loaded, and any hydration
   that changes the price or offer type clears a pending confirmation, so a publish is always a fresh tap on exactly the price and offer
   the coach sees. No other hardening. Failing-before test (Sol W2 lane run 37341467340 has the 2 challenges). #346 has 127 lines of
   room; tests that do not fit go to #347.
2. #347 (W3 own content): fix only item-list problems from the W12-119 / W12D-120 reports (ops/reports/AUD-*-W12-119.md,
   AUD-*-W12D-120.md): first-person copy around line ~343, the missing `isLive` handling if it lets a coach publish or price wrongly.
3. Restack: #347 <- #346, then #348 <- #347 (resolve the conflict once; list every hunk), #349 <- #348, #350 <- #349, #351 <- #350
   merge-only (one merge commit each, tree == merge-tree).
4. Evidence: one mobile CI lane at the new #351 head with the wizard + money specs and typecheck; PR CI on #345's chain as GitHub runs it.
5. Comments ending READY FOR AUDIT, each stating exactly what changed since the previous head: FIX ROUND 3 (B-WIZ3-122, agent 122) on
   #346; FIX ROUND (or RESTACK if no content change) on #347; RESTACK on #348 (with the conflict hunks), #349, #350, #351. Write
   ops/lanes122/notify/wizard.txt with all new full heads.

### AUD-OPUS-MON1-122 / AUD-SOL-MON1-122 — coach money screens m#348-#351, first full review (T4: payouts, earnings, money copy)
Lens: Claude Opus 5.5 and GPT-6.1 Sol, independent. Time box 60 minutes including the wait for the restack.
Current heads: #348 90501f847e03cf4cc1071503436acdd459643103 (N1), #349 35aa8163, #350 6fb21216, #351 352d768e (full shas: `git -C
/home/user/workspace/growth-project-mobile rev-parse pm349` etc.). Split of the closed m#332, sitting on the wizard (#345 -> #346 -> #347);
#349/#350 are red by design until #351; the train lands as one (A5 rule 11). Never reviewed at these heads (READY by operator 116,
5975773999). Backend they call (coach payouts, refunds/reversals, earnings) is deployed: b#674/#676/#677/#703 in production since 14:56.
Item-list problems only: money shown wrong to the coach (earnings, fees, payouts, refunds), a payout or Stripe Connect flow that dead-ends,
another coach's or client's data shown, false money copy, App Store problems. Read now at these heads. Builder B-WIZ3-122 is restacking
#348-#351 onto a fixed #347 (with one conflict in #348): poll ops/lanes122/notify/wizard.txt and the PR comments every 5 minutes; when it
posts READY, check the delta (merge-only trees; #348's conflict hunks) and post ONE verdict per PR at the NEW exact heads (4 comments). If
the restack is not READY by 17:15 PDT, post at the current heads and say so.

### AUD-OPUS-WL4-122 / AUD-SOL-WL4-122 — wizard delta m#346/#347 + lockout delta m#352-#354 (T4) (launch when a slot frees)

Part 1 lockout (now): m#352 da686cea, #353 78ed4e07, #354 be5c74b1 (full shas: rev-parse pm352 etc.; FIX ROUND 3 by B-LOCK3-121: false
"bank reversed" copy fixed; report ops/reports/B-LOCK3-121.md). Prior: Sol L3 #352 RC 6001848621, #353 RC 6001849106, #354 APPROVE; Opus

is fixed on the backend by b#725 (under review in DUN1). One verdict per PR at the exact head.
Part 2 wizard (after B-WIZ3-122 posts READY; poll ops/lanes122/notify/wizard.txt): #346 delta (B-346-3 / C-346-7 fix only) and #347

### B-TR11-122 — trials train: Sol B-673-3 fix + main refresh with the push-preferences move (T4 money/access; stack lock: trials)
Builder: Claude Opus 5.5. Time box 60 minutes (READY by about 16:50 PDT). Lock ops/lanes122/locks/trials.
Heads: b#671 565893b5c969fdc937d03f3a5b947bcb8d100b11 (base main) -> #672 193c6f9ac3f57a10b8ff87fa3874ee0f190dd9b7 (2,959/3,000) -> #673
91d0adcbb3b1c5eef10266006a6a6a8c6b33f6a5 (2,996/3,000: no room) -> #706 87aaf126036bc7604dceb3ab55f0ddf255519950 (tests) -> #707
2bb4b368f39d8a380a48086c6c79d21cb4cc34b9 (1,249/1,500). Verdicts at these heads: Opus APPROVE all five (6004664932, 6004665581, 6004666466,
6004667126, 6004667898); Sol APPROVE #671/#672/#706/#707, REQUEST CHANGES #673 (6004661734, B-673-3). Read both reports:
ops/reports/AUD-SOL-TR10-122.md and AUD-OPUS-TR10-122.md (lens rounds are posted; you may read both).
Work, in order (one push per PR; space your pushes at least 2 minutes apart):
1. Main refresh (Opus C-672-L1, binding): main 5cde6253 merges clean into #671 but the train conflicts in
   src/notifications/notifications.service.ts because main's push train (b#692) moved the notification preference mapping to
   src/notifications/push/push-preferences.ts. Merge origin/main into #671 (clean), then merge the new #671 into #672 and resolve:
   `trial_ending` must be mapped in push/push-preferences.ts exactly like main's other kinds, so the notice three days before the first
   charge is sent (a test that proves the trial_ending notice is delivered with main's push sender). List every hunk. Restack #673, #706,
   #707 merge-only (resolve and list any hunk if one conflicts).
2. B-673-3 (Sol, operator ruling: B, false customer-facing claim in an ordinary sequence): a client opens package A's free-trial checkout,
   dismisses it without saving a card, then opens package B from the same coach: the offer for B must match what B's checkout actually
   does. Preferred behaviour: dismissing A without a card does not use up the one trial: B's checkout retires A's unstarted open trial
   attempt (Opus C-673-11 says an abandoned attempt is retired before the next checkout: verify whether that happens for a DIFFERENT
   package of the same coach) and B gets the trial the offer showed. If that cannot be done safely and small, the offer must instead say
   the trial is unavailable/in progress with a working next action. Same-package resume and already-started trials unchanged. Code goes in
   #707 (top slice; #673 has no room); Sol's proposed 12-line test is in ops/aud-122/AUD-SOL-TR10-122/B-673-3-normal-offer-mismatch.diff.
3. Evidence: one backend CI lane at the new #707 head (tsc + trials specs + the new tests). #671's PR CI (all required checks) green.
4. Comments ending READY FOR AUDIT stating exactly what changed: MAIN REFRESH on #671 (merge-only proof), FIX ROUND (B-TR11-122, agent 122)
   on #672 (conflict hunks + push-preferences line), RESTACK on #673/#706, FIX ROUND on #707 (B-673-3). Write
   ops/lanes122/notify/trials.txt with the five new full heads. Cancel superseded runs of your own branches after each push.

### B-DUNFIX-122 — dunning fix round, standing by (T4; stack lock: dunning, taken only when B-DUNR3-122 has released it)
Builder: Claude Opus 5.5. Time box: until 18:15 PDT. Standing by costs nothing: poll every 5 minutes (sleep between polls), do not read
code in depth until there is work.
Trigger: the AUD-OPUS-DUN1-122 / AUD-SOL-DUN1-122 lenses post verdicts on the dunning train (b#687, #688, #704, #705, #724, #689, #690,
#691) and b#725 after B-DUNR3-122's restack (watch PR comments and ops/lanes122/notify/dunning.txt; the lenses' reports
ops/reports/AUD-*-DUN1-122.md). While waiting, read only ops/reports/B-DUNR3-122.md, B-DUND2D-121.md and the notify file.
When any verdict is REQUEST CHANGES with item-list Bs: wait until ops/lanes122/locks/dunning is released by B-DUNR3-122 (or the operator
tells you it is yours), take the lock, and fix every B in the piece that owns the code (b#725 is base main and separate). Then restack
upward merge-only, one push per PR, pushes at least 2 minutes apart, cancel superseded runs. Failing-before test per B. One CI lane at
the top head (tsc + dunning specs). Comments: FIX ROUND n (B-DUNFIX-122, agent 122) on fixed pieces, RESTACK on the others, each ending
READY FOR AUDIT. Write ops/lanes122/notify/dunning-fix.txt with all new full heads. A B that is an edge case under _COMMON_122 item 6:
list it for the operator instead of fixing. If both lenses APPROVE everything, end with "no fix round needed".

them or the account; coaches never see client chat text; notes survive chat deletion; flag EXPO_PUBLIC_FF_ROMAN_CHAT unchanged. Item-list
problems only: one user's chats shown to another account (sign-out/sign-in on the same phone is NORMAL use), delete that does not delete,
false copy, a dead end. CI was cancelled in the outage and re-run by the operator: do not block on queued checks. Lands as one train.

Verdicts: Sol APPROVE #372-#375, REQUEST CHANGES #376 (6004856689) B-376-1: a client deletes the chat that is open in the live Roman
screen from the history list, goes back, still sees the erased text, and the next message goes to the erased session id and fails. Fix:
when a confirmed delete erases the session the live screen holds, the live screen drops that session (clears the transcript, starts a
fresh session on the next send). Sol's three sequential counterexamples: probe run 37384807869 (evidence ops/aud-122/AUD-SOL-RCH1-122/).

#345-#348, #350, #351 are approved by both lenses or Opus; do not change them except merge-only restack.
B-349-1 (Opus 6004992019): a coach taps one charge of a $100 monthly plan the client has paid three times; the page shows "$100.00" but
"Clients paid $300" and a $6 "TGP fee (2%)", and if the latest renewal failed it says the client was never charged and nothing reached
payouts (the backend breakdown sums every renewal of the plan). OPERATOR RULING: option 1, mobile only in #349: label the breakdown
truthfully as the plan's totals so far (e.g. "This plan so far: clients paid $300 ...") distinct from the single charge amount, and keep
the breakdown (no "never charged" claim) when only the latest renewal failed. No backend change. Plus every item-list B in Sol's MON1
verdicts (ops/reports/AUD-SOL-MON1-122.md once posted). If moneyCopy.ts changes, say which strings (it touches #348's review).

hunk in the comment. Prisma: `prisma validate` + `prisma format` check; migration name unchanged (Opus D1: keep) and still the newest-safe
additive migration (check main's migration list; say if its timestamp sorts before any main migration and whether that matters for
`migrate deploy` — it applies regardless of order). Then merge new #721 into #722, #722 into #723 (resolve and list any hunk). Run

dual APPROVE). Sol's earlier #347 verdicts were restack-only (5998774888) and delta-only (6005093397); Opus did the first full W3 review

CoachPackageEditScreen.tsx, tests). Item-list problems only: a coach publishes a price or offer different from what the screen shows,
a dead end in creating or editing a package, false copy, a client charged wrongly. Coach backend (b#674/#676/#677/#703) is in production.

the rest). #669/#670 are NOT in scope. Binding (A9 "Roman day-1 jobs"): OR-115-1 neutral roman.safety_route action + restricted reason
code; OR-115-2 crisis templates without box-2 consent; Roman never reads CoachingSession private notes, bloodwork, purchases/invoices
or other users' rows (docs/roman-client-context.md in #667). Item-list problems only: Roman sees or reveals another user's data or a

(B) trials (B-TR11-122, report ops/reports/B-TR11-122.md): #671 6bf110fb0f1c7ed7c0e6281c88ded177ddc357e1 (main merge; main touched ci.yml,

Prior: Opus APPROVE all five at the old heads; Sol APPROVE four + RC #673 B-673-3. Check: B-673-3 closed for an ordinary client, the

ops/aud-122/AUD-SOL-BC1-122/). Fix, in the piece that owns the code, failing-before test each:
1. Sol B-727-1: clients normally assigned to a master program disappear from that program's audience, so the coach cannot schedule.
2. Sol B-728-1: a sub-coach's ordinary audience-picker request shows other authors' owner-only program names.
3. Opus C-727-1 (operator: fix now, before the flag can turn on): archived clients must not be in any broadcast audience.
4. Opus C-728-1 (operator: fix now): editing a draft without a status keeps its current status (never sends it).

coach's packages to codes. Fix exactly as Opus wrote: in create(), when scope.issuerId is set and package_id or grant_mode is present,
answer 403 code_package_head_coach_only before assertBindablePackage and write nothing; update the B-658-1 unit case; add Opus P1 as the

evidence ops/aud-122/AUD-SOL-W3F-122/). Opus APPROVE full W3 (6004996279). Operator ruling: all three are B (ordinary coach paths):
1. B-347-1: a coach edits the name/description of the free first package; Save rejects the unchanged $0 price. Saving unchanged $0 must work.
2. B-347-2: a coach enters a trial on a live monthly package and saves; the server does not keep it (main's backend has no trial column yet;
   trials ship with b#671-#707 and mobile m#338), yet the editor says saved and the buyer preview promises a trial. Never claim or preview a
   trial the server did not return; the simplest truthful fix (e.g. hide/disable the trial input until the saved package carries the
   trial field) is fine. Check m#338 (dual APPROVE, held) so the two do not fight; say how they compose.
3. B-347-3: a coach skips the first package, finishes setup, creates a paid package from the Home checklist, and has no action to publish
   it. Give the editor a reachable publish action for a draft (same publish call and confirm as the wizard).
Failing-before test each (Sol's probe should pass). One push to #347. Then the money train: B-MON2-122 owns #348-#351 until it writes
ops/lanes122/notify/money.txt and releases ops/lanes122/locks/wizard; after that, take the lock, merge your new #347 into #348, then

a3eb3206d3805dc765962528b6a1a3ab6e085b09 -> #668 dabed7388157c64a50ff32bc8e7e003c001af339. Reports: ops/reports/AUD-OPUS-RMN1-122.md,
AUD-SOL-RMN1-122.md (probes: Sol run 37387394935, evidence ops/aud-122/AUD-SOL-RMN1-122/; Opus ops/aud-122/AUD-OPUS-RMN1-122/).
First merge #665's head into #666 and #666 into #668 (Opus: clean). Fix, failing-before test each:
1. Opus A-666-2 (safety-router.ts:34/68/72-87): common crisis phrasings ("I have been thinking about ending my life" and Opus's 7 probes;
   "I took 20 of my sleeping pills" -> the 911 reply) must get the crisis reply before any AI call, and never a 403 consent error (OR-115-2:
   crisis templates without box-2 consent). Run all of Opus's probe phrasings.
2. Sol B-666-4: a client asking whether to skip insulin before training must not receive that instruction unchanged (reply post-check /
   medication rule; safe redirect to their clinician).
3. Sol B-668-1 (Sol's id; different from Opus's closed B-668-1): when the coach's remaining AI credit cannot cover a reply, the client
   gets the capacity message, and the remainder is not silently bypassed.
4. Sol B-668-3: a daily-total claim (breakfast + lunch = 780 kcal) must be validated against the sum, not one meal.
Not in this round: Opus decision 2 (locked clients and Roman context: follow-up C, flags off) and #669/#670. Restack nothing above #668.
One push per PR, at least 2 minutes apart; cancel superseded runs; re-run cancelled required checks so they RUN at the new heads. One CI
lane at #668 (tsc + Roman specs + probes). Comments: FIX ROUND 2 (B-RMN2-122, agent 122) ending READY FOR AUDIT. Write
ops/lanes122/notify/roman.txt with the new heads.

instant confirm, request expiry, reminders, coach and client calendar screens, phone time zone; coaches decide their times (open hours,

retries): a booking at a time the coach did not offer, a confirmed booking the other side never sees, a request that cannot be approved
or declined, false copy, a dead end. Never reviewed: first full review. One verdict per PR.

B-658-9). Change = clean merge of main 5cde6253 + one fix commit (FIX ROUND 2 6005531674; report ops/reports/B-INV4-122.md): a team
sub-coach sending package_id or grant_mode to POST /coach/codes gets 403 code_package_head_coach_only before the package check and
nothing is written (operator ruling 121 13:14). Check: B-658-9 closed (Opus P1 passes; P3 refused as intended), the merge adds nothing

reconciliation matches older message text; drop a "Not sent" bubble only when the server has a row with the same client_message_id

If the fix cannot fit #377's cap, open a NEW small PR on top of #377 (base = #377's branch, Conventional Commits title, under 1,500)

1. Opus B-367-1 (6005655881): a request that needed approval and was not answered in 48 hours shows "Status unavailable..." in Calendar and
   in the "Session request closed" push; production sends `expired`. Add the status and a plain label ("Request closed: your coach did not
   answer in time" or similar, impersonal voice) in calendarUi.tsx.
2. Sol B-367-1 (6005711262): a client choosing a regular appointment from the welcome fallback gets a welcome-call heading and a false
   "welcome booked" completion. Heading and completion must match the type booked.
Also, cheap and in #367 only: Opus C copy "coach will see it in Calendar" -> where coaches really see it (booking inbox). Merge origin/main

columns with defaults that reproduce current behaviour (one additive migration), enforced in the same advisory-locked validation as the
scheduling train on main (b#712-#720), open-slots honours them, coach GET/PATCH endpoints next to open hours (coach-only, own data). No
onboarding change. One NEW PR on main (backend main 95b0a05d), under 1,500 lines, Conventional Commits title, no banned casts. Tests:

time), never a generic error or "Roman is unavailable". Map backend 503 ROMAN_CAPACITY_REACHED (b#669, not merged yet) and

a coach edits a draft from $99 to $199 and taps "Make <name> live" and the old $99 offer goes live. Fix in the wizard screen on #347's

the merge: prisma/schema.prisma and src/common/env-validation.ts (main brought coachless b#721-#723, invite codes b#658, MWB 409 b#733,
coachless map b#734). Check ONLY the merge commit: for those two files (and the migrations folder order), the result is the plain union of

ops/reports/M-ROMANCAP-122.md; OPENING comment 6006235540). Owner 11:20: when a client hits the daily AI cap, every AI entry point shows a
graceful pop-up "You've used your maximum AI allotment today." (with when it resets), never a generic error. Check: the pop-up shows on the
real cap codes the backend sends (503 ROMAN_CAPACITY_REACHED from b#669, AI_DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED, 429) in Roman chat (client + coach) and the
AI guide; a crisis message is never blocked by the app; no false copy (reset time). Operator rulings: the platform-wide spend cap and the AI
guide token limit are backend follow-ups, not Bs on this PR. One verdict.

Builder Opus. Time box 35 minutes. Found by M-ROMANCAP-122 (report ops/reports/M-ROMANCAP-122.md, decision 3): src/ai/ai.service.ts
reserveDailyTokens throws 429 AI_DAILY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED before any safety handling, so a client who used up the day's AI guide limit and then
types a crisis message (self-harm, overdose, "I want to die") gets the limit pop-up instead of 988/911. src/ai/ai-guardrails.service.ts
already has crisis patterns. Normal-user story: a struggling client who chatted a lot today types "I want to kill myself" in the AI guide
and must see the 988/911 message, never "You've used your maximum AI allotment today." Fix: run the crisis check first; a crisis message
gets the safety reply without spending quota or calling the model (match Roman's crisis reply wording if one exists in main; impersonal
voice). Do not change the token limit itself (operator: separate follow-up). NEW PR on backend main (pull first), under 1,500 lines,

coach-code-redemption tests that were red on main 6aff479c (fixed on main by b#734 a70533d5; not this PR). Owner day-1 scope (10:32
"COACHES DECIDE THEIR TIMES AND AVAILABILITY"): per-coach minimum notice (default 5 min), booking window (default 120 days), buffers
before/after (default 0), optional daily maximum; defaults reproduce today's behaviour; enforced in the locked booking validation; open
slots honour them; coach GET/PATCH own options. Operator accepts the builder's 4 design defaults (per coach not per type; buffers add up
and need not fit open hours; daily max counts requested+scheduled+pending on the coach's local day; coach self-moves not bound). Item-list
problems only: a client can book a time the options forbid, open slots show a time that then fails, a coach can read/change another
coach's options, defaults change today's behaviour, the migration is not additive. One verdict.

Lens: Opus and Sol, independent. Time box 25 minutes. b#736 f2dd87ad8cf57906e5693413a6a61f9ec88dd8d5 (base main; 213 lines; builder comment
6006627739; report ops/reports/B-AIG-122.md). Story: a client who used up today's AI guide allowance types "I want to kill myself" or "I took
a whole bottle of pills" and gets the fixed 988 / 911 reply instead of "limit reached". Check: the crisis check runs before consent, the
token limit and the model; no allowance spent; non-crisis messages unchanged (limit still applies, normal answers unchanged); fixed text is
impersonal and correct (988 for self-harm, 911 for emergencies); no false positive on ordinary fitness phrases a normal client types
("kill this workout", "I'm dying after leg day", "overdose on cardio") that would replace a normal answer with a crisis reply. Builder's
proposed follow-ups (hourly 20/h /ai/chat throttle, shared pattern list after Roman merges, daily limit size) are C unless you give a
normal-user story. One verdict.

### AUD-OPUS-RMN4-122 / AUD-SOL-RMN4-122 — Roman live turns delta b#669 + b#670 (+ closes #666 Bs) (T4 safety/AI)
Lens: Opus and Sol, independent. Time box 35 minutes. Stack: #667 c5102cae -> #665 4dde3ffe -> #666 8cfad607 -> #668 fefe73c6 -> #669 -> #670.
#667/#665/#668 dual APPROVE; #666 has Opus A-666-3 (named-medicine overdose "a whole bottle of Tylenol" got no 911) and Sol B-666-5 (a day
total mentioning "meals" not checked against the whole day) whose fixes sit on #669 (operator ruling: review them on #669).
#669 ef71cb9c1a5aa7c148bfdb1241830cc7a9beb9d2 (FIX ROUND 1 6006562381; 1,609 lines vs #668; finishes the C2 WIP, merges #668, stub for #668's
red tests, B-668-1 pool tests, A-666-3, B-666-5); #670 dc159eaf24dafafd32df4c06ed75f08971b31bbc (RESTACK 6006623533; merge-only; golden 27/27).
Report ops/reports/B-RMNC2-122.md. Check: A-666-3 and B-666-5 closed with tests that fail on the old code; overdose threshold (5+, or bottle/
pack/handful/bunch) does not fire on "took 2 Tylenol for my headache"; #669's own Bs from earlier rounds (B-651-1/4/5, OR-115-1/2, B-651-9)
closed; nothing from the item list added; #670 is merge-only. One verdict per PR (#669, #670) plus a one-line "#666 Bs closed via #669: yes/no"

comment 6006513689 (+ CI follow-up 6006620708); report ops/reports/B-WIZ6-122.md. Review ONLY the conflict resolution in src/api/packagesApi.ts,
src/screens/coach/CoachPackageEditScreen.tsx and the four test files whose assertions changed: (a) one save path (lower-case currency, billing
only when changed, switching to one-time clears interval/count) and one publish path (main's, with idempotency key); (b) the edit screen keeps
main's price rule and messages AND the train's durable create; "Make <name> live" disabled while unsaved (B-347-4 must stay closed); live
packages show "Unpublish package"; (c) nothing either side had is silently dropped. Builder decisions (operator default keep): $0 one-time
allowed per main's fee rule; blocked "Make live" is a disabled button. Story check: a coach edits a price and taps Make live without saving -> the
button is disabled, so the old price is never published. One verdict.

### AUD-OPUS-MO1-122 / AUD-SOL-MO1-122 — merge-only checks after dunning landed: b#655 + b#735 (T4)
Lens: Opus and Sol, independent. Time box 12 minutes. Both PRs were dual APPROVED; main then moved to eb2e9e03 (dunning) and each got a
main merge that tree_check flags. Verify ONLY that each new head is the approved head + main with the PR's own change unchanged:
- b#735 082d4653aa88ab1e4b05817a3a305fc138805026 = approved e07d6e13 (AV1 dual APPROVE at 32d81207, then a merge-only update to a70533d5) + main

Lens: Opus and Sol, independent. Time box 15 minutes. m#352 fa2c14fb62bdc75e0c6f4c39742111527c8876ae = ONE merge commit of the audited top

Review ONLY the two hand-resolved spots: (1) src/services/api.ts request interceptor order (lockout stamp first, then main's token read and
account check): a locked client still lands on the lockout screen, an AI cap answer still shows the pop-up, MWB/messaging handlers from main
still run, nothing dropped; (2) src/navigation/README.md both sections kept. Confirm nothing else differs from a clean union (PR diff vs main
unchanged in size: 40 files +7,025/-50) and PR CI green at the head. One verdict ("APPROVE (merge resolution)" or REQUEST CHANGES).

### AUD-OPUS-AV2-122 / AUD-SOL-AV2-122 — coach booking options mobile m#381 (T3/T4 scheduling)
Lens: Opus and Sol, independent. Time box 25 minutes. m#381 feab0c3b74479d2c3b644e91f301a76d92222c0e "feat(scheduling): coach booking options

b#735 (dual APPROVE, merging now) adds GET/PUT coach booking options (minimum notice, booking window, buffers...). Story: a coach opens
Settings > booking options, sets "at least 24 hours notice" and saves; clients then cannot book inside 24 hours and see a plain reason.
Check: the editor reads and saves exactly the backend's fields and limits; the backend's refusal sentences show; the entry hides on 404/403;
the changed client message (no more "four months" promise) matches the backend's window; nothing from the item list. One verdict.

### B-AIG2-122 — b#736 fix round (AI guide crisis before the limit) (T4 safety)
Builder Opus. Time box 30 minutes. b#736 f2dd87ad8cf57906e5693413a6a61f9ec88dd8d5; both lenses REQUEST CHANGES (Sol 6006699712, Opus
6006734594; reports ops/reports/AUD-SOL-AIG1-122.md, AUD-OPUS-AIG1-122.md). Bs (all ordinary use):
- misses: "I took a whole bottle of Tylenol" (named-medicine overdose -> 911); "I am going to hang myself" (-> 988).
- false positives that replace a normal answer: "overdose on cardio", "can you overdose on creatine?", "I hurt myself deadlifting, can I train?".
Fix: align with the Roman detector already reviewed on b#669 ef71cb9c (src/roman/... safety router: named-medicine overdose threshold 5+ or
bottle/pack/handful/bunch; first-person intent for self-harm phrases); copy its patterns (do not import from the unmerged stack) or share
them only if trivially possible. Questions about supplements/training/injury get a normal answer. Tests: each of the five sentences above
plus "kill this workout", "I'm dying after leg day", "took 2 Tylenol for my headache" (no crisis) - each new test fails on f2dd87ad. One push.

account-deletion manifest (both sides kept, nothing dropped, schema composes, deletion covers both sides' tables), and
src/messaging/messaging.service.ts (broadcast card included only while FEATURE_COACH_BROADCASTS is on; main's reply preview only while
FEATURE_MESSAGING_CORE_V2 is on). Story: with both flags off at launch, a client opening a thread sees exactly what main shows today; with
broadcasts on, a coach's broadcast card shows in the thread. Required checks green at ff2594db. One verdict.

(residual of B-666-5): src/roman/guardrails/roman-post-check.ts ~359-363 adds individual-entry facts whenever DAY_TOTAL_CLAIM fails without
consulting AGGREGATE_CLAIM, so after breakfast + lunch a reply like "your meals add up to 450 kcal" (no "today") passes with one meal's number
instead of 780. Fix: aggregate wording (meals/total/altogether/so far, with or without "today") is checked against the whole day's total.
Sol saved ordinary assertions + controls in its report/aud dir: use them; new tests fail on ef71cb9c; existing 19-case repair spec and
correct single-meal replies still pass. Then restack #670 (merge #669 only). One push per PR, spaced 2+ minutes. CI lane + PR CI green.

  Both lenses RC'd it on 10-02 for three Bs (UTC times, double inbox entries, no device push) that the builder says main already fixed.
  FIX ROUND 1 6006805839; report ops/reports/B-643-122.md. Verify each of your old Bs is fixed in main with a pointer to the code/test.

  FIX ROUND 1 6006810677; report ops/reports/B-341-122.md. Check B-341-1 (settings save one change at a time), B-341-2 (failed save says what
  went wrong), the "Mute all" copy (email stops too), device zone sent once on sign-in/zone change.
Story: a client books a 9am session; the evening before at a normal hour she gets one reminder push showing 9:00 in her own time; tapping it
opens the session. Builders' proposed Cs (quiet hours holding some 24h reminders, no clock time when zone unknown, blank settings screen on
load failure, save finishing after the screen closes): C unless you give a normal-user story. One verdict per PR.

### M-AVAIL2-122 — m#381 fix round B-381-1 (T3 scheduling)

ops/reports/AUD-OPUS-AV2-122.md / AUD-SOL-AV2-122.md). B-381-1: a coach saves 14+ days of minimum notice (editor allows up to 30) and every
client then sees "no open times in the next two weeks" because the client picker only shows the next 14 days. Operator ruling (Opus's
recommended fix): the editor refuses minimum notice of 14 days or more with a plain sentence (e.g. "Minimum notice must be under 14 days so
clients can see open times."), and the stepper/inputs stop at the largest value under 14 days. Test fails on feab0c3b. Also fix the note that

Sol RC 10-03 (5972066633) B-339-1 (unknown results claimed a definite outcome) fixed per builder. Check: the repo-wide voice check passes on the

did not revert main's newer copy; no logic change beyond copy and the check. Builder proposed Cs C-339-a/b/c and keeping the three hashed

main allowed for locked clients was dropped in a way that blocks billing/export/deletion/coach thread, the test-only commit changes only tests,
