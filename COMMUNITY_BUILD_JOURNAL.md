# Community Build Journal — R64 Live Log

**Purpose:** Live state of every Community Expansion PR. Pushed to `tgp-agent-context` at every state change (R64 protocol) so sandbox death does not lose work-in-flight.

**Authoritative plans:**
- `STEP0_COMMUNITY_INTEGRATIONS_AND_GAPS.md`
- `COMMUNITY_PRODUCT_PLAN.md`
- `COMMUNITY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

**Backend HEAD at plan time:** `659e0ccc74c47f9c985a26b582987253ec9fdb40`
**Mobile HEAD at plan time:**  `4b7587e47694d1640b1484d1a2a38d40f307afac`

**R0 reminder for every commit on every PR:**
- NO "Coming soon" strings anywhere (production, comments, test titles, docblocks, regex)
- NO `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck`/`as any`/`as unknown as`/`as never`/`as never as X`
- NO `.catch(()=>undefined)`, NO empty `catch(e){}`, NO spinner-only empty states
- `@ts-expect-error` with one-line justification IS allowed
- Commit author: `Dynasia G <dynasia@trygrowthproject.com>`, title-only, no Co-Authored-By / Generated-By

## Event log (most recent first)

### 2026-06-02 20:35 PT — Wave 1 builders DISPATCHED in parallel (isolated worktrees)
- Bradley picked execution shape **A** (Recommended): P0-0A + P0-0B parallel preflight, then v1-1 alone, then v1-2 + v1-4 + v1-6 parallel.
- P0-0A builder (Opus 4.8) launched against `/tmp/build-p0-0a`, branch `fix/wearables-samples-ingest-route`, base `659e0cc`. Subagent id: `p0_0a_builder_hk_ingest_post_route_mpxikz9f`.
- P0-0B builder (Opus 4.8) launched against `/tmp/build-p0-0b`, branch `fix/wearables-cloud-connector-wiring`, base `659e0cc`. Subagent id: `p0_0b_builder_cloud_connector_wiring_mpxilim2`.
- Pre-dispatch collision audit: ZERO file overlap between the two PRs.
- Both PRs include explicit feature flags (`FEATURE_WEARABLES_INGEST_POST`, `FEATURE_WEARABLES_CLOUD_CONNECTORS`) defaulted false in production, with typed disabled-error responses (not 404, not "Coming soon", not spinner-only).
- Builders will commit, push, open PRs, then return SHA + PR# + R0 sweep + test results.

### 2026-06-02 19:44 PT — Journal created
- Approved by Bradley to start preflight + v1-1/2/3 with R64 pushes after every state change.
- Plans pushed at commit `8a3c665`.
- Next: dispatch P0-0A builder (Opus 4.8) against the planner's exact spec.

## P0-0A — wearables: restore on-device ingest route

- **Why:** Mobile HK / Health Connect / Samsung Health POST to `/v1/wearables/samples/ingest`; backend `src/wearables/samples/wearable-samples.controller.ts` only mounts `GET /v1/wearables/samples`. Mobile writes 404 silently in production.
- **Scope:** backend only, ~180 LOC.
- **Files:**
  - `src/wearables/samples/wearable-samples.controller.ts` — add `@Post('ingest')` handler
  - `src/wearables/samples/dto/ingest-samples.dto.ts` — new Zod schema (`IngestSampleSchema`, `IngestSamplesBodySchema`)
  - `test/wearables/samples-ingest.e2e-spec.ts` — e2e tests (auth, cross-user denial, batch caps)
- **Feature flag:** `FEATURE_WEARABLES_INGEST_POST`, default false in production.
- **State:** BUILDER RUNNING (Opus 4.8 in `/tmp/build-p0-0a`).

## P0-0B — wearables: register cloud connectors

- **Why:** 8 cloud connector modules (Oura/Fitbit/Garmin/WHOOP/Polar/Strava/Wahoo/Withings) exist in `src/wearables/connectors/*` but `WearablesModule` does not import them. Plus 3 sub-landmines the planner caught: circular imports on Garmin/WHOOP, registry token mismatch (local `WEARABLE_CONNECTORS` symbols), Strava doesn't bind to registry token.
- **Scope:** backend only, ~140 LOC.
- **Files (planner spec):**
  - `src/wearables/wearables.module.ts` — import 8 modules with `forwardRef` on Garmin & WHOOP
  - `src/wearables/connectors/{garmin,whoop}/*.module.ts` — `forwardRef(() => WearablesModule)`
  - All 8 connector modules — align to canonical `WEARABLE_CONNECTORS` token + add registry binding where missing
  - `test/wearables/connector-registry.spec.ts` — assert all 8 discoverable, OAuth metadata returned, webhooks mounted
- **Feature flag:** `FEATURE_WEARABLES_CLOUD_CONNECTORS`, default false.
- **State:** BUILDER RUNNING (Opus 4.8 in `/tmp/build-p0-0b`).

## v1-1 — community: v1-1 schema workspace cohorts

- **Why:** Foundation for everything Community. 11 logical tables, partitioned messages table, full RLS plan.
- **Scope:** backend Prisma + migrations + RLS spec tests, ~900 LOC.
- **State:** queued behind P0-0B.

## v1-2 — community: v1-2 backend services REST

- **Why:** Service layer + 38 REST endpoints over the schema.
- **State:** queued behind v1-1.

## v1-3 — community: v1-3 mobile community tab

- **Why:** Mobile Community tab + The Lab + cohort feed + DM (18 screens).
- **State:** queued behind v1-2 (can develop against schema mocks earlier).
