🔴 P0 — Experience-Breaking: Fix Before Any Coach Onboards a Sub-Coach

SC-1 — Sub-Coaches Are Completely Blocked From the Command Center
The Problem
src/coach/command-center/command-center.controller.ts:62 applies @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, CoachGuard, NoActiveSubCoachGuard) at the class level. src/common/guards/no-active-sub-coach.guard.ts:15–18 throws ForbiddenException for any user with an active TeamSubCoachAssignment row. The guard message says "billing or financial surfaces" — but it is applied to the entire Command Center: overview, at-risk, win-streaks, inbox, and action-queue. None of these are financial endpoints.
A sub-coach who opens the app sees a completely blank Command Center. No roster overview, no at-risk clients, no win-streaks, no inbox. They have been assigned clients and have no operational view of them whatsoever. The guard was intended to block sub-coaches from the ltv-metrics controller (which is genuinely financial) but was applied at the wrong level and now gates the entire coaching operational surface.
Big-Picture Solution
Remove NoActiveSubCoachGuard from CommandCenterController entirely. Move it only to LtvMetricsController and any billing-adjacent controllers where financial data genuinely should be head-coach-only. This is a one-line change on command-center.controller.ts:62 — remove the guard from the class decorator. Note that this fix alone is not sufficient: SC-2 must also be fixed simultaneously, otherwise sub-coaches are unblocked but still see empty data.

SC-2 — Command Center Queries Scope by User.coach_id, Which Is Always the Head Coach's ID for Sub-Coaches
The Problem
Even after removing the guard (SC-1), every query in command-center.service.ts resolves clients via where: { coach_id: coachId, role: 'student', deleted_at: null }. Under the Phase 11 overlay model (documented in sub-coach-assignment.service.ts:17–29): "User.coach_id ALWAYS points at the head coach." A sub-coach's ID never appears in User.coach_id — their clients are scoped through SubCoachAssignment rows.
This means getOverview(), getAtRisk(), getWinStreaks(), getInbox(), and getActionQueue() all return zero clients for any sub-coach, regardless of how many clients they've been assigned. The SubCoachScopeService.getAuthorizedClientIds() method exists precisely to solve this (sub-coach-scope.service.ts:50–78) but is never called from the Command Center.
Big-Picture Solution
Inject SubCoachScopeService into CommandCenterService. At the top of each public method, replace the inline prisma.user.findMany({ where: { coach_id: coachId } }) roster resolution with:
const clientIds = await this.subCoachScope.getAuthorizedClientIds(coachId);

getAuthorizedClientIds() already handles both cases: head coaches get their full roster via User.coach_id; sub-coaches get their assigned clients via SubCoachAssignment. The clientIds array is already the input to every subsequent query in each service method — no further logic changes required. SC-1 and SC-2 together are a two-file fix that fully restores the Command Center for sub-coaches.

SC-3 — Sub-Coach Engagement Score Rewards Sending One Message Over Reviewing 40 Client Check-Ins
The Problem
sub-coach-analytics.service.ts:52–60 — Signal 1, worth +20 points out of 100 — detects sub-coach activity by checking whether the sub-coach sent at least one CoachMessage in the last 7 days. The code comment admits this is a proxy: // +20 logged in within 7 days (proxy: sent at least one message in the last 7 days).
The outcome is perverse:
A sub-coach who logs in every day, reads every check-in, approves every workout, and reviews all client progress but sends no messages: 0/20
A sub-coach who sends one message on Monday and ignores the platform all week: 20/20
This is the single highest-weighted individual signal in the scoring model. It actively punishes the most conscientious sub-coaches (who let their clients lead conversations) and rewards superficial engagement. A head coach using this score to evaluate their team is being given backwards information.
The other three signals have similar proxy problems: Signal 2 checks "responded within 48h of a check-in" (good), Signal 3 checks "created or updated a workout routine this calendar week" (reasonable), Signal 4 checks "≥70% session-day adherence across the team" (correct concept, right metric). Signal 1 is the outlier that corrupts the entire score.
Big-Picture Solution
Replace Signal 1 with a composite "active coaching" signal built from actions that only happen when the sub-coach is genuinely working:
Check-in review: Did the sub-coach open (read) any client check-in this week? Track via a CheckInRead event or a read_at timestamp on CheckIn rows. Worth +10.
Workout approval: Did the sub-coach approve or reject any pending workout this week? This is already an auditable action. Worth +10.
If neither event type exists yet, add a coach_session signal emission on any authenticated request from a coach-role user (lightweight middleware, fires once per hour per user to avoid noise). Signal 1 then becomes: clientSignal.findFirst({ where: { user_id: subCoachId, signal_type: 'coach_session', recorded_at: { gte: sevenDaysAgo } } }). This correctly answers "was this sub-coach actively using the platform this week" without requiring them to send a message.

SC-4 — Client Assignment and Reassignment Send No Notification to the Affected Client
The Problem
sub-coach-reassign.service.ts — the single entry point for all client → sub-coach assignment changes — contains zero notification dispatches. Searching the file for notification, notify, push, emitter, and nudge returns no results. When a head coach assigns a client to a sub-coach, or moves a client from one sub-coach to another, the client receives no communication of any kind.
The client opens the app and discovers a stranger is now reviewing their check-ins, approving their workouts, and managing their programme — with no explanation. They have no context that a change has occurred, no introduction to the new coach, and no acknowledgement that their previous coaching relationship has ended. Most clients will interpret this as a platform malfunction. The silent handoff is especially damaging for fitness coaching because the client-coach relationship is personal: trust in the platform depends on feeling that the platform is in control of these transitions, not hiding them.
Big-Picture Solution
After the serializable transaction commits in runReassignTransaction(), dispatch three actions:
1. Notify the client via push notification + automatic in-app message from the new sub-coach:
"Hi [client name], I'm [sub-coach first name] and I'll be your coach from here. Looking forward to working with you — feel free to message me anytime! 👋"

This message is created via MessagingService.sendAsCoach(newSubCoachId, clientId, { body: ... }) using the same pattern as all other coach messages. It creates a natural conversation starter and immediately establishes the new coaching relationship.
2. Notify the new sub-coach via push: "[Client name] has been added to your roster." with a deep link to the client profile.
3. Notify the previous sub-coach (on reassignment, not first assignment): "[Client name] has been moved to another coach's roster." — so they are not left wondering why the client disappeared from their list.
All three notifications use NotificationsService and CoachAlertEmitter which already exist in src/notifications/. The AuditLog entry already written at the end of the transaction serves as the traceable record. This is a pure wiring task — no new infrastructure required.

🟡 P1 — Data Integrity: Fix Before Coaches Make Decisions From These Numbers

CC-1 — pending_actions Is a Duplicate of open_alerts
The Problem
command-center.service.ts:255 returns pending_actions: openAlerts. Line 252 also returns open_alerts: openAlerts. These are the same variable. The Command Center shows two KPI tiles displaying identical numbers. A coach seeing "Open Alerts: 4" and "Pending Actions: 4" cannot distinguish between them because there is no distinction. One tile is meaningless.
Big-Picture Solution
pending_actions should be a compound count of items requiring direct coach action: pending workout approvals + threads where is_coach_turn = true + flagged weight logs not yet acknowledged. All of this data is available in the same Promise.all block that populates getOverview(). This separates "things TGP has flagged" (open_alerts) from "things you need to actively do right now" (pending_actions) — a meaningful and useful distinction for a coach starting their day.

CC-2 — active_today Counts Internal System Signal Events, Not Client Check-Ins
The Problem
command-center.service.ts:186–189 computes active_today from ClientSignal rows where recorded_at >= oneDayAgo. ClientSignal includes PTM model recalculations, background streak updates, weight log writes, and system events — not just coach-visible check-in forms. A client who submitted no check-in but had a background PTM prediction run at midnight appears as "active today." Meanwhile check_in_rate_7day queries the actual CheckIn table — so these two metrics measure different things with no explanation.
Big-Picture Solution
Change active_today to query CheckIn WHERE logged_at >= today_midnight in the coach's timezone — the same table as check_in_rate_7day. Both tiles then measure the same thing (submitted check-in forms) at different time windows. If tracking raw app sessions is separately valuable, add a distinct last_seen_today tile querying ClientSignal with a clear label, so "checked in" and "opened the app" are never conflated.

CC-3 — At-Risk top_factor Gives Coaches Three Generic Strings Instead of Real PTM Factors
The Problem
command-center.service.ts:302–310 — topFactorLabel() — produces one of: "No recent activity", "No app activity in N days", "High churn risk — multiple signals fired", or "Declining engagement signals." The PtmPrediction.factors column contains per-factor contribution data (e.g. "streak dropped 14→0, contribution −0.28") which is already parsed and surfaced correctly in churn-intervention.service.ts:246–247. The command center ignores this column entirely.
Big-Picture Solution
Include the factors column in getRiskBoardForCoach(). Replace topFactorLabel() with parseFactors(p.factors).label — the same logic already proven in churn-intervention.service.ts. Coaches see the actual behavioural reason for a red/amber flag (e.g. "No check-in in 9 days", "Streak dropped from 14 to 0", "Weight not logged this week") rather than a generic bucket label.

CC-4 — Inbox Builds Thread State From 1,000 Messages In-Memory: Threads Beyond Position 1,000 Disappear
The Problem
command-center.service.ts:425–448 fetches the most recent 1,000 CoachMessage rows and iterates them in JavaScript to build a per-client thread map. A coach with a long message history may have threads whose last message was beyond position 1,000. Those threads never appear in the inbox. The coach sees total_unread: 3 but only 2 threads visible — the missing thread has unread messages counted in the total but no visible row to tap.
Big-Picture Solution
Replace with a findMany({ distinct: ['client_id'], orderBy: [{ client_id: 'asc' }, { created_at: 'desc' }] }) query. This returns exactly one row per thread (the latest message) with no row limit, using the existing index. Thread count is always accurate regardless of message history depth.

CC-5 — Check-In Rate Is Binary Participation, Not Adherence
The Problem
command-center.service.ts:242 divides the count of distinct clients who checked in at least once in 7 days by rosterSize. A client who checked in once in 7 days is counted identically to one who checked in all 7 days. A coach with 10 clients each checking in once gets check_in_rate_7day: 1.0 — displayed as 100% — even though average daily adherence is 14%.
Big-Picture Solution
Change the numerator from distinct user_ids to total check-in rows submitted. Divide by rosterSize × 7. Rename the field check_in_adherence_7day. The coach sees "your clients submitted 43% of expected check-ins last week" — an honest signal that drives intervention rather than false confidence.

EFF-1 — Effectiveness Score riskDeltaComponent Executes 2 DB Queries Per Client in a Loop
The Problem
coach-effectiveness.service.ts:306–330 loops over all eligible clients and issues two sequential prisma.ptmPrediction.findFirst calls per client — one for the earliest prediction and one for the latest in the 60-day window. A coach with 50 eligible clients = 100 sequential DB round-trips every time the scheduler fires. With 20 coaches on the platform this is 2,000 sequential queries per scheduled run.
Big-Picture Solution
Replace the per-client loop with two bulk queries: fetch all predictions within the broadest relevant window for all eligible client IDs in one findMany, then group and filter per-client in memory. Reduces 2N sequential queries to 2 regardless of roster size.

EFF-2 — Coaches Cannot See Their Own Effectiveness Score
The Problem
CoachEffectivenessService.getLatest() and listHistory() have no coach-facing controller endpoint. The score is only accessible via the owner-only admin surface. A coach who earns a high score never sees it. A coach who scores poorly gets no signal to improve. The system monitors coaches without giving them the feedback loop that would make the monitoring worthwhile.
Big-Picture Solution
Add GET /coach/my-effectiveness to coach.controller.ts scoped to the calling coach's own ID. Return the latest score, bucket, component breakdown, and a 30-entry trend history. Coaches see their own performance data and understand which behaviours (messaging frequency, client retention, risk reduction) lift their score.

EFF-3 — CoachEffectivenessService Computes Zero Scores for All Sub-Coaches
The Problem
coach-effectiveness.service.ts:207–218 resolves clients via User WHERE coach_id = coachId. For a sub-coach, User.coach_id is always the head coach's ID — so the client list is always empty, and the score always returns { score: 0, bucket: 'developing', factors: [empty_roster] }. Every sub-coach on the platform permanently shows as "developing" with zero score on the head coach's team dashboard.
Big-Picture Solution
Inject SubCoachScopeService. Replace the direct prisma.user.findMany call with SubCoachScopeService.getAuthorizedClientIds(coachId) followed by prisma.user.findMany({ where: { id: { in: clientIds } } }). One change, correct scores for all coaches.

LTV-1 — estimated_ltv Is Derived From a 6-Month Industry Average on New Accounts, Displayed as a Real Number
The Problem
ltv-metrics.service.ts:197–207 uses a hardcoded 6-month lifespan stub whenever fewer than 3 cancellations exist. estimated_ltv_cents is computed as rpcmCents × 6 and displayed as a dollar figure. A new coach with 10 clients at $300/month sees $1,800 estimated LTV per client — a number derived entirely from an industry default. The lifespan_is_estimate: true flag is in the API response but the mobile client renders the dollar figure without a visible caveat.
All the data needed for a real calculation already exists in ClientPurchase: created_at (when a client started paying), canceled_at (when they stopped — non-null means churned), entitlement_active (the canonical "still paying" flag), and billing_type = 'recurring' to filter to subscription clients.
The Correct LTV Formula Using Existing Data
Step 1 — Churned client tenure:
For every recurring purchase where canceled_at IS NOT NULL:
tenure_months = (canceled_at - created_at) / 30.44

This is real historical data — the exact lifespan of every client who has ever left.
Step 2 — Live client tenure (conservative lower bound):
For every recurring purchase where entitlement_active = true:
tenure_so_far_months = (now - created_at) / 30.44

Every live client has at least this much tenure. Their true final tenure is still growing, so using now is conservative — it pulls the blended average down slightly, which is the honest direction to err.
Step 3 — Blend both pools:
all_tenures = churned_tenures + live_tenures_so_far
blended_avg_tenure_months = mean(all_tenures)

As the coach's client base matures, live clients age into their real tenure and the blended average converges to the true number automatically — no manual recalibration ever needed.
Step 4 — LTV:
RPCM = MRR / active_client_count
LTV = RPCM × blended_avg_tenure_months

Edge case — re-subscribers: A client who cancels and re-subscribes produces two ClientPurchase rows. Group by client_user_id and sum tenure across all rows for that client before averaging. This correctly credits the coach for total relationship length.
Big-Picture Solution
Replace the entire stub block in ltv-metrics.service.ts:177–207 with this logic. Remove the 3-cancellation threshold and the 6-month fallback completely — even one real data point (a single live client who has been subscribed 2 months) produces a more accurate LTV than an industry average. The new calculation degrades gracefully: a brand-new coach with their first client on Day 1 shows a small real tenure number rather than a fabricated 6-month figure.
The mobile UI behaviour changes based on data maturity:
0 clients ever: Show LTV: — with tooltip "Start adding clients to calculate LTV."
1–4 total client tenures: Show the real calculated number with an asterisk and tooltip "Based on [N] client(s) — will become more accurate as your roster grows."
5+ total client tenures: Show the number with no caveat — the sample is large enough to trust.
This requires zero schema changes. All required fields (created_at, canceled_at, entitlement_active, billing_type, client_user_id) already exist on ClientPurchase.

LTV-2 — net_revenue_retention_pct Is Gross Logo Retention, Not NRR
The Problem
ltv-metrics.service.ts:269–271 computes this as 100 - churn_rate. The code comment explicitly calls it a stub. True NRR credits coaches for clients who upgrade their package — it can exceed 100%. The current metric cannot exceed 100% and ignores all expansions. A coach who moves half their clients to a higher tier sees no improvement in this number.
Big-Picture Solution
Rename the field to gross_logo_retention_pct internally. Display it in the mobile UI as "Retention Rate" (not "NRR") with a tooltip: "Calculated as 1 minus your monthly churn rate. True Net Revenue Retention (which credits you for upgrades) is coming soon." Add a ClientPurchase.upgraded_from_purchase_id foreign key to enable true NRR once upgrade tracking is built.

LTV-3 — zero_churn_streak and all_time_peak_rpcm Are Gamified Vanity Metrics That Are Currently Inaccurate
Context
zero_churn_streak counts consecutive months with zero cancellations. all_time_peak_rpcm is the highest revenue-per-client-per-month the coach has ever achieved. Both are motivational "personal best" metrics — essentially gamification elements designed to encourage coaches to keep their streak alive and chase their peak.
Are they useful? Yes, genuinely — for the right coach. A coach tracking their zero-churn streak will intervene proactively on at-risk clients to protect it. A coach comparing current RPCM to their all-time peak has a concrete target. These are the same mechanics as fitness app streak counters, and they work for the same psychological reasons.
The current problem (ltv-metrics.service.ts:279–290): zero_churn_streak is re-computed in-memory from cancellation history on every load. all_time_peak_rpcm calls estimatePeakRpcm() which returns the current RPCM — not a historical maximum — because the persistence table was never built. A coach who had their best month in March and is now in a slower period sees all_time_peak_rpcm showing today's lower number. The streak resets to zero on every cold compute if monthly boundary logic glitches. The metrics are broken, not conceptually wrong.
Big-Picture Solution
Build the coach_ltv_peak table:
CREATE TABLE coach_ltv_peak (
  coach_user_id     UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES "User"(id),
  peak_rpcm_cents   INT  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  peak_month        DATE,
  zero_churn_streak INT  NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  last_computed_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

Add a monthly cron (alongside coach-effectiveness.scheduler.ts) that upserts peak_rpcm_cents = MAX(current, existing_peak) and correctly recalculates zero_churn_streak from the month boundary. getMetrics() reads from this table for both fields. The metrics become accurate historical values and the gamification elements work as intended.

Coach Effectiveness Score — What Is It?
The CoachEffectivenessScore is an internally computed 0–100 rating for each coach, calculated on a schedule and stored append-only in CoachEffectivenessScore rows. It is built from four weighted components:

Buckets: developing (< 50), consistent (50–74), high-performer (≥ 75).
Currently it is used exclusively on the owner's admin dashboard to rank coaches. It has the three problems documented above (EFF-1, EFF-2, EFF-3). Once those are fixed, it becomes a genuinely useful tool — both as an owner management signal and as a coach self-improvement feedback loop.
