### Checklist item 1 — R124 BUILD MATRIX
PASS — Verified current checkout and PR API both resolve to head SHA `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0`:
- `git rev-parse HEAD`: `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0`
- `gh api repos/BradleyGleavePortfolio/growth-project-backend/pulls/490 --jq .head.sha`: `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0`

### Checklist item 2 — R76 §6 append-only invariant
PASS — Independent below-floor enumeration at SHA `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0` returned `149` migrations for prefixes lexically below `20261219000000`, matching the updated 146→149 fixture expectation. Enumeration saved locally at `/home/user/workspace/pr490_lensb_below_floor_migrations.txt`.

### Checklist item 3 — FLOOR_TS structural pin
PASS — In `test/roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts` at current SHA, the structural pin is intact: `const FLOOR_TS = '20261219000000';` appears at line 212, `const self = '20261219000000_conv_review_coach_reviewed_at_idx';` appears at line 231, and `expect(self.slice(0, 14)).toBe(FLOOR_TS);` appears at line 233.

### Checklist item 4 — NEW commit 40f31a3c Path C resolution
PASS — Commit `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0` changes only `test/roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts` with 4 inserted comment lines. The added block at lines 225-228 documents that the pinned literal is a deliberate human-review tripwire and references `BradleyGleavePortfolio/growth-project-backend#495` for the dynamic-hash alternative. Issue #495 exists, is OPEN, and is titled `chore(test): evaluate dynamic content-hash invariant for KNOWN_BELOW_FLOOR_COUNT (PR #490 P3 follow-up)`. The new commit is comment/documentation only: no executable logic changed, no assertions weakened or removed, and added-line banned-cast token scan returned 0 matches.

### Checklist item 5 — ENOENT root cause / RLS spec path
PASS — The RLS spec update is correct and complete. `test/partial-refund-decision-rls-migration.spec.ts` now references `20261215000300_named_regimes_and_partial_refund_decision`, that migration directory exists, and a stale-reference grep for `20261214000000_named...` in the changed spec returned 0 matches. The append-only timestamp comparison was also updated from `20261218000100 > 20261214000000` to `20261218000100 > 20261215000300`.

### Checklist item 6 — R18 OWNS scope
PASS — PR diff scope is exactly two modified test files with `16 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)`: `test/partial-refund-decision-rls-migration.spec.ts` and `test/roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts`. No production files, Prisma migration files, workflow files, or other surfaces are changed.

### Checklist item 7 — R3 commit identity
PASS — Both PR commits (`59315faf7b5f39179a11e99695c6eefdb82b06ca` and `40f31a3c2a1e563cf0070276d4b2f938e17430f0`) have author and committer exactly `Bradley Gleave <bradley@bradleytgpcoaching.com>`. Forbidden-token scan of both commit messages returned 0 matches.

### Checklist item 8 — R75/R100.A2 banned-cast net delta
PASS — Added-line scan across the full PR diff for `as any|as unknown as|as never|@ts-ignore|@ts-nocheck|<any>|Coming soon|.catch(()=>` returned 0 matches. No banned-cast or placeholder net delta introduced.

### Checklist item 9 — R74 test:src density
PASS — `git diff --numstat` shows all additions are under `test/`: `3/3` in `test/partial-refund-decision-rls-migration.spec.ts` and `13/1` in `test/roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts`. Non-test additions = 0, so R74 density is N/A for this test-only lane.

### Checklist item 10 — R117/R123 assertion-bearing tests
PASS — Every modified `it()` block retains real `expect(...)` assertions. In `partial-refund-decision-rls-migration.spec.ts`, the changed original-migration reader is exercised by the `is a NEW additive migration...` block at lines 54-67, and the timestamp-order block keeps `expect('20261218000100' > '20261215000300').toBe(true);` at line 124. In `roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts`, the append-only block keeps `expect(dirs).toContain(self);`, `expect(self.slice(0, 14)).toBe(FLOOR_TS);`, and `expect(belowFloor).toHaveLength(KNOWN_BELOW_FLOOR_COUNT);` at lines 232-235. No no-op assertion pattern was introduced.

### Checklist item 11 — R109 no-half-ass
PASS — Added-line scan for `.skip`, `.todo`, `xit`, `xtest`, `fit`, `fdescribe`, and `"Coming soon"` returned 0 matches. The PR introduces no skipped, focused, todo, or placeholder tests.

### Checklist item 12 — R20 tracking-issue discipline
PASS — New commit `40f31a3c` references `#495`; `gh issue view 495` confirms the issue exists, is OPEN, and tracks evaluating a dynamic content-hash/manifest alternative versus ratifying the pinned-literal tripwire. Labels currently returned by the API are `tracking` and `migrations`, which is sufficient tracking-issue state for this P3 follow-up.

### Checklist item 13 — R79 50-failures sweep
PASS — Reviewed the complete `16 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)` diff in severity-pass order against R24-R73; no new defects found.
- Security: no auth/RLS production policy changed; test-only fixture path/comment/count changes only.
- Data integrity: below-floor count independently enumerates to 149; renamed RLS original migration path exists; no migration SQL was edited.
- Concurrency: no concurrent code paths, async behavior, locking, or transaction behavior changed; only static tests/comments changed.
- Error handling: `readFileSync` fixture target now points at an existing migration directory; no stale old-path reference remains in the changed spec.
- Performance: no production runtime cost; the only enumeration remains in a static Jest migration spec.
- Architecture: scope remains static drift-detection tests for migration/schema integrity; Path C documents the tripwire rationale and delegates alternative design to issue #495.
- Code quality: no banned casts, placeholders, skipped/focused tests, or no-op assertion additions detected; modified tests remain assertion-bearing.
- Infrastructure: no workflow, CI, package, dependency, generated, or migration-file changes.

### Checklist item 14 — Re-check prior P3s
PASS — Prior P3-1 (dynamic/manifest Path D not considered) is resolved by commit `40f31a3c`: the current spec now documents the pinned literal as a deliberate human-review tripwire at `test/roman-coach-reviewed-migration.spec.ts:225-228`, and issue #495 remains open to track the dynamic-hash/manifest alternative.

PASS / SUPERSEDED — Prior P3-2 (stale PR-body line references) is not re-filed. Current PR-body references for the previously cited file lines now match this SHA: `KNOWN_BELOW_FLOOR_COUNT` is line 229, `expect(self.slice(0, 14)).toBe(FLOOR_TS);` is line 233, the RLS hard-coded path is line 44, the timestamp comparison is line 124, and `readNewMigrationSql()` spans lines 25-36. I did observe separate PR-body doc drift in the BUILD MATRIX LOC summary (`+12/-4` there vs current `+16/-4`), but this is non-code metadata drift after the documentation-only fixer commit and does not require a new P3 because the authoritative diff/files are otherwise verified above.
