# R81 BACKFILL LEDGER — Audit Debt Inventory

**Filed:** 2026-06-14
**Operator:** Bradley Gleave
**Trigger:** R81 instituted 2026-06-14 8:39 PM PDT after F1 PR #326 (`05af67e6`) merged without adversarial audit. Operator caught the gap and ruled: NO MERGES EVER without verbatim audit cycle.

## The Fuck-Up
Sixteen (16) PRs were merged into `main` on backend and mobile repos under CI-only gates BEFORE R81 existed. Each shipped to `main` without an independent adversarial auditor sweeping it under R72 exhaustive standard. That is the gap. R81 closes it forward; this ledger closes it backward.

## Itemized List — All 16 Un-Audited Historical Merges

## Current Status (2026-06-15 06:21 UTC / 11:21 PM PDT) — AUDIT PHASE COMPLETE

**All 16 backfill PRs + the live OPEN PR #401 now have independent adversarial audits on file.** Sixteen audit docs in `audits/`. R81 backfill audit phase: **DONE**. Fixer phase: queued, deferred to a later session per operator directive.

| PR | Audit Doc | Verdict | Fix Status |
|----|-----------|---------|------------|
| #200 | PR200_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | REVERT_REQUIRED_P0 (trailer) + 2 P2 + 1 P3 | Trailer → AUDIT_DEBT_PR200.md (Option A); code findings → followup |
| #242 | PR242_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | CHANGES_REQUESTED (P1 + 3 P2 + 5 P3) | Fixer needed — write-only MMKV gate causes celebration re-fire across app restarts |
| #248 | PR248_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | CHANGES_REQUESTED (P1 + 3 P2 + 2 P3) | Fixer needed — Zod `.strict()` detail schema mismatch with backend `{post, upload_targets}` shape |
| #249 | PR249_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (2 P2 + 1 P3) | Polish-only — defer |
| #250 | PR250_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (2 P2 + 2 P3) | Polish-only — defer |
| #251 | PR251_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (3 P2 + 2 P3) | Polish-only — defer; F1 voice-note-transcript routing bug surfaces when indexer wires up |
| #252 | PR252_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (2 P2 + 1 P3) | StripeConnectCard + PermanenceMarker components built but NOT wired to any host screen — follow-up wiring PR must be audited specifically for the PR #242 MMKV-gate pattern |
| #253 | PR253_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | CHANGES_REQUESTED (P1 + 2 P2 + 3 P3) | Fixer needed — undo of removeExercise silently negated by autosave drop-guard refetch |
| #254 | PR254_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (2 P3) | Polish-only — defer |
| #326 | PR326_AUDIT_2026-06-14.md | CHANGES_REQUESTED (P1 + 2 P2 + 1 P3) | Fixer needed — dispatcher-claim race; check-and-set broken (50-Failures #28/#29/#44) |

| #402 | PR402_REAUDIT_2026-06-14.md | **CLEAN_NO_FINDINGS** | Merged at fea925a8 — the R81 cycle exemplar |

## Fixer Queue (priority order for next operator)

**Urgent (P1, blocks flag-on)** — surface order matches likely flag-flip-imminence given all 16 surfaces are launching together on Day 1:

1. **PR #401 fixer** — OPEN PR sitting CI-red on `main`; the most immediately actionable cleanup. Fix the DI cycle via SecurityGuardsModule pattern; fix the partial-refund TOCTOU; rerun R79 pin tests; re-audit; merge.
2. **PR #399 fixer** — `ParseUUIDPipe(v4)` → CUID-compatible validation on dismiss/act-on routes (routes are dead until fixed). Plus 403→404 leak fix, throttle decorators, TOCTOU collapse on markDismissed/markActedOn, cooldown-race redesign.
3. **PR #326 fixer** — `updateMany({where: {id, status: 'pending'}})` with `count===0 → throw` for the per-drop check-and-set. Plus @Throttle, Zod response, AuditService write.
4. **PR #253 fixer** — clear `deletedKeysRef`/`deletedSignaturesRef` in the inverse-addExercise branch of `applyInverse`. Add integration test for delete→undo→refetch cycle. Plus accessibilityLiveRegion on toast.
5. **PR #242 fixer** — gate `onFirstPayment` on `await hasSeenFirstPayment(coachId)` (read-on-mount); add regression test with pre-set persisted gate. Plus P2 polish.
6. **PR #248 fixer** — drop `.strict()` on detail schema OR accept `upload_targets` optionally; add `CommunityLessonDetailScreen.test.tsx` covering 404, release-locked, null-url, flag-off.

**Pre-flag-flip (P2-only PRs)** — once urgent queue clears:
7. **PR #396 fixer** — wire telemetry emits OR correct narrative; real-post-id in create-path storage keys; @ArrayMaxSize on media arrays; explicit @Throttle on reads.
8. **PR #400 fixer** — composite `(coach_id, coach_reviewed_at)` index; Zod `.strict()` on response; @Throttle.
9. **PR #398 fixer** — collapse `assertCheckInOfCoach`+update to single `update({where: {id, coach_id}})`; narrow response with `select`; @Throttle.
10. **Polish wave** — #249/#250/#251/#252/#254/#397 P2/P3 polish; can be batched into one cross-PR cleanup PR per repo.

**PR #200 followup** — code findings (2 P2 + 1 P3) still open per the original PR200 audit's `PR-200-FOLLOWUP` brief. Trailer is settled via AUDIT_DEBT_PR200.md Option A; do not rewrite history.

## Sequencing principle

All 16 surfaces launch together on Day 1 (pre-launch, no individual flag-flip priority). Therefore: order fixers by **severity** (P1s first, then P2-only PRs), not by feature-priority. The PR #402 R81 cycle is the template — single-loop audit→fix→re-audit→CLEAN→merge, one PR at a time, R74-clean commits, push every 2 min.

## Trailer Sweep Result
Of 16 merged PRs, only **PR #200** carries a banned `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7` trailer. The other 15 sweep clean (only legitimate human co-authors `Bradley Gleave` and `Dynasia G`). PR #200 trailer handled via Option A (AUDIT_DEBT_PR200.md) — no history rewrite.

## R81 Enforcement Going Forward
Every PR — old or new — must follow:
1. CI green + doctrine sweep clean + R74 commit identity verified
2. Independent adversarial auditor (Opus 4.8, R72 exhaustive, no time budget, R77 read-only)
3. Audit doc at `audits/PR<N>_AUDIT_<date>.md` pushed to tgp-agent-context
4. If `CLEAN_NO_FINDINGS` → merge authorized
5. Any finding (P0–P3) → fixer dispatched per finding → re-audit → cycle until CLEAN
6. Only then `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`

R81 is tied with R0 at top priority per operator directive 2026-06-14 8:40 PM PDT: "RULE 81 stays above all else with R0 / MAKE IT ABOVE ALL WITH R0".
